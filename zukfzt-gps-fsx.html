Learn the basics of setting-up and how to use the GPS in FSX with a tutorial on how to set-up a flight plan from airport to airport and air to airport.

Because of this, the sheer number of lakes being displayed on my in game GPS is killing performance. My GPS updates at times as slow as once every 30 seconds. Outside scenery isn't affected, just the GPS. Is there an easy way to stop the in game GPS from showing all these bodies of water? I'm sure that would boost performance. SIMGPS, an Arduino driven realistic GPS for FSX or P3D - you can build. 
Hi! I am new to FSX and I am having trouble finding information on the basics. I have been finding some tutorials and advancing little by little but I am having a real rough time with finding what to do next. Is there any advice for someone completely. Help please!!!!! About a week ago I was flying the default Cessna 172 and pressed shift 3 to see the GPS screen and where the screen would appear it flashes but didn't come up. I went into the pull down screen and looked in the open view and the GPS was ticked. I've checked other planes.  Tried mapping on my keyboard but nothing happens. What command Gps For Fsx, free gps for fsx freeware software downloads. I have looked up all the planes in the standard package. I have gone on YT and I see that there is some type of secondary package that I can buy from somewhere. But lemme tell youzes - you have your own language. Every time that I think I found in some forum some good info, it is written with a coded language assuming that I know how to get this thing, from where, and how to install it. I am a pretty smart guy I think, but your words leave me perplexed. I am a private pilot in the midst. Hey guys, Can anyone here tell me how i can bring Found a great replacement for the default GPS in a freeware 787. It's got a much better map with more zoom level options, text info about surrounding airports and nearby aircraft, and it can automatically tune navigation radios. So far the only drawback I've found is that it doesn't always pull the correct ILS frequencies.

Hi guys, I’m returning to FSX after a short foray into xplane and just wondered where you get your freeware planes from nowadays?

The Flight Replicas Super Cub works in P3DV4 except for the GPS being 32 bit. Is there an easy way to make it use the default P3D GPS?

In FSX you can plan a flight by saying “I want to fly from here to here” either using low or high altitudes etc and it plans a path for you to follow on the gps. Is there anything remotely similar to this on x-plane?? Or am I just incredibly dumb? Thank. How do u use the GPS on the Airbus A321 and Boeing 737 on Flight Simulator X? thanks. 
I'm working on my instrument rating, and am convinced an at home fsx or x-plane setup would help. So I've been looking at what's the best desktop for the job. I remember when I was younger that when FSX came out, it could like hardly run. so I have been looking at really decked out PCs. But it's dawned on me that I really don't need any graphics or anything outside of the plane; I just need a realistic representation of the instruments, and not have them glitchy or jumpy.

Holy crap I got it working! It was easier than I thought, even sat at an out of the way gate at LAX and listened to the live ATC for a while and realized there are a few missing pieces of my flight knowledge. How the blue sparkly frick does one fly an assigned departure? Is that information I can plug into the default GPS in FSX and use with my autopilot? Is it possible to fly directly to specific VORs with the FSX GPS or do I have to learn to fly those by hand? For the record I'm fairly confi.

This might seem like it's simple to look up but is surprisingly confusing. Countless tutorials and posts online but hard to get a simple answer. Now even asking for a how to just confirmation that it can be done? To start I'm quite the novice but can plan a flight plan and use AP to control Heading, Altitude, etc but I have to manually change the heading to what it says on the GPS. Can any stock plane on FSX automatically change course to head to the planned VOR and then automatically change. After 6 weeks or so of using FS2004 quite successfully I find there is still just one thing about it I dont like too much - the GPS.It certainly isnt so clear and easily readable as the basic one that came with FS2002.Does any body know? Has anyone tried? Is it possible by any means to copy/move. I recently switched over to X-Plane from FSX, figuring a brand new flight sim would be more fun than the dated FSX. My problem now is that I feel X-Plane is waaaaay over my head. I've been interested in flight since I was a kid, but I'm not a pilot. FSX seemed pretty straightforward when it came to planning a flight route and jumping into the plane to follow it. I had figured out autopilot and ILS landings well enough, and I felt like I knew what I was doing. Now, though, with X-Plane FSX - Setting a direct route to any destination in the GPS Easy step by step instructions. Whenever you want to set in the GPS a direct route to a destination you want to fly to, follow the next steps. Hi Everyone, I've started learning about STARs and SIDs, and I want to try to find a way to fly an actual STAR or SID in FSX (Steam). My question might be more geared towards /r/flying , but I thought I'd start here. I have a lot of questions at the bottom, so I'll start by addressing what I think I know.

Have been using fsx to shoot approaches for a good while and I keep on noticing that the gps glideslope for both the non-g1000 and the g1000 Cessna 172s does not work. Does the gps really have not glideslope or am I doing something wrong. Hi, Can anybody tell me if it`s possible (and how)to change the arrival runway in a flight plan being followed by the GPS? I`m using Radar Contact. I got vectors to a runway at Charles de Gaul which was different to the one in my flight plan. It was very confusing because of the number of runways. I recently purchased the Mindstar GNS 430/530 so that I can practice use of the GPS while not paying 0+ per hour (aircraft rental), but instead, I can learn the GPS intimately for essentially nothing ( one time purchase). I'm quite inexperienced with modding FSX though, and would love some help. So here's what I'm trying to do. I don't need anything fancy (no panel insets), but just want a "shift 1-9" type pop-up in most/all of my regularly used aircraft. I found the official.

Hi there, I plan to invest in some flight sim with aircraft that are realistic in terms of buttons pushed, indications and ifr route/sid/star etc database, what addon should I get for either fsx that I have, or what completely new software such as an equivalent of fsx should I get to get the most realism so I can get the most practice out of it?
